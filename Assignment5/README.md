ANSWER TO QUESTION:

No value of E in the range (0, 999) changed the optimal path found by my program.
The very high (999) and very low (0.01) values for E did alter the Utilities of some of the states, but no change to path occured.
I tried all of these values to reduce and increase the number of iterations through the matrix to increase/decrease the accuracy of the utilities.
With only one iteration, my code finds the same path as it does with a complete number of iterations (E=0). The utilities are different but the path is the same.
